## Exercises     
If you put a "a" in front of whatever you want, it will not response with Would you really be happy if you had whatever you want. For example if you typed "I want a burrito", it will respond with a random response. If your sentence does not have "I want to", it will not respond properly also if your sentence requires the answer to switch the subject, the response will no make sense. For example : I want to kill you", the proper response should be "Would you really be happy if you kill me? but it will respond with "What would it mean to kill you?"
If you typed You and me in a sentence as the subject, the reply will not make any sense. For example, when you type "You and me were meant to be" it will respond with " Why do you and that I and you?" Magpie needs to be able to scan for a verb in between you and me or it will respond incorrectly.
